# Othello GUI

A Java implementation of the board game Othello (also known as Reversi) I made some time ago.

It includes the game logic, a JavaFX GUI, as well as a (marginally-better-than-random) bot opponent player.

## How to run:
You will need to have Java 11 installed to be able to run this.

1. navigate to `out/artifacts/OthelloAI_jar` in terminal

2. run `java -jar --module-path lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml OthelloAI.jar`
